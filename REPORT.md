# 2024 Graduate Program Exit Survey: Course Ranking

- Selected `Q35_*` as the rating/preference field because it explicitly asks students to rank core courses from most to least beneficial; converted ordinal ranks to a preference score (Rank 1=8 ... Rank 8=1).
- Top ranked course: **ACC 6400 Advanced Tax Business Entities** (avg preference score 6.6, median rank 2.0, top-2 box 67.3%, n=55).
- Bottom ranked course: **ACC 6540 Professional Ethics** (avg preference score 3.15, median rank 6.0, top-2 box 5.5%, n=55).
- Caveat: rankings come from ordinal drag-and-drop responses, so differences between adjacent average scores should be interpreted directionally rather than as interval-scale gaps.
